\section{Knowledge Management}
\label{sec:km}

Software development is inherently a knowledge-intensive activity. Software
designers and developers leverage their software-development skills, along with
domain knowledge, past experiences, and the knowledge of team members, to solve
the problem at hand, such as implementing a new feature or resolving a bug.  In
small, collocated teams, knowledge management is not a big challenge---people's
expertise on different parts of a system is typically known. New team members
can use informal communication channels to identify experts and seek their help
as needed.

However, as teams increase in size or become geographically distributed,
knowledge management starts to become challenging. In large or distributed
teams, system knowledge---\eg expertise, dependencies, best practices---is
spread across multiple people, locations, and (in the case of outsourcing) even
organizations~\cite{Desouza:2006}. In such projects, a knowledge-management
system is needed to create \textit{project memories} that can serve different
needs, such as assisting new team members in identifying experts to reach out to
for specific questions, or helping existing team members determine the relevant
artifacts, and the people they might need to coordinate with, for performing a
task. Existing attempts at creating such project memories include
Hipikat~\cite{Murphy:2005} and Codebook~\cite{Begel:2010}.

%% First, it should assist new team members in understanding the project with
%% little or no face-to-face guidance and identifying experts to reach out to for
%% questions. Second, the system should help existing team members identify the
%% artifacts relevant, and the people they might need to coordinate with, for
%% performing a task. Existing attempts at creating such project memories include
%% Hipikat~\cite{Murphy:2005} and Codebook~\cite{Begel:2010}.

A service company has a large, geographically distributed employee base, with
frequent employee churn at project and organization levels. To maintain
consistent delivery quality, it is essential to manage knowledge at the project
level. Moreover, because services is a highly price-sensitive business, there is
also the need to be cheaper and better, by doing more with fewer or less-skilled
resources. Driven by this need to gain competitive advantage in increasingly
competitive markets, it is essential for companies to build \textit{organization
  memories} that store the collective knowledge of past engagements, processes,
and people to increase productivity and reduce activities that ``reinvent the
wheel.'' Such a system can enable the organization to leverage learnings and
solutions from past services engagements in the context of a new similar
engagement, even when members from the past projects are not around.

The need for organization-level knowledge bases is well established in the
management literature~\cite{davenport2000working,bollinger2001managing}. Equally
well known is the fact that creating an effective organization-wide knowledge
base is very challenging~\cite{McKinsey:1999,Harvard:1999,Ernst:1997}. There are
challenges in: (1) \textit{knowledge creation}---how to codify explicit and
tacit knowledge and motivate individuals to contribute; (2) \textit{knowledge
  retrieval}---data versus information versus knowledge; (3) \textit{knowledge
  governance}---legitimacy, relevance, and quality of contributed
knowledge. Alavi and Leidner~\cite{Alavi:2001} present a good overview of
research issues in organization knowledge management. Prior research suggests
that IT is incapable of capturing organizational
knowledge~\cite{malhotra2004knowledge,mcdermott2000information}, but also
postulates that IT is the strongest enabler for organization knowledge
management systems (OKMS).

Next, we present three scenarios illustrating the need for OKMS in service
companies. Then, we discuss promising research directions based on our
experience with building systems intended to promote knowledge reuse in these
scenarios.

\subsection{Scenarios for OKMS}

In this section, we present three typical scenarios in service delivery that can
benefit from an OKMS.

\subsubsection{Troubleshooting}

One of the common forms of service engagements is application maintenance, where
the expectation from the service provider is to take over a client's
applications and handle service requests for them.  Service requests come in the
form of trouble ``tickets'': users of the applications can raise a ticket,
logging a problem they have experienced. This is similar to defect logging in
bug repositories, such as Bugzilla, where users of an open-source software can
enter the details of a problem that they encountered.  The main difference is
that, in typical software development in open-source communities, there is no
obligation on the development team to address the defects in a timely
fashion. Likewise, even in a product setting, the development team can
prioritize the order in which they address defects.  In services context, the
service provider must resolve the ticket in a timely manner, often under a
service-level agreement. For example, a critical bug must be resolved within
6~hours, failing which there could be financial consequences for the provider.

Software development in service organizations is not pure custom
implementation---often, packaged applications, such as SAP, Oracle, and COTS
products, with client-specific customizations and external libraries are
used. The cause of a problem ticket could be in the customization done for the
client, in the way external code is used, or even a bug in the external code. If
the issue is with the configuration or the external code, it is likely that the
same (or a similar) issue has been resolved previously for another client;
access to that information would make the resolution of the current ticket more
efficient and effective.  Therefore, a knowledge base that stores past resolved
tickets across clients would be a useful organization-wide resource.  In a way,
such a knowledge base would be similar to public question-and-answer forums on
various software languages, tools, and open-source projects on the web.

\subsubsection{Software Development Projects}

Another common form of service engagement is business-process transformation,
where the responsibility of the service provider is to IT-enable a business
process, such as payroll management, vendor management, or order-to-cash, for a
client. Some business processes (\eg payroll management) would be required by
all clients, whereas other processes would be common within a domain only (\eg
claim-management process in the insurance domain).  The client expectation is
that the service provider possesses adequate knowledge of the generic version of
a particular process, creates client-specific variations, and implements the
system. Typically, this requires significant domain expertise.

A knowledge-management system that stores past business process implementations
can help in this scenario. The past solutions need to be organized by domain for
easy retrieval of relevant information. Appropriate documentation that explains
the standard and customized portions of past solutions needs to be available,
along with the solution code. While designing a new business-process solution,
the team can search the repository to learn about variations of the process to
be implemented and, if the client requirements are similar to a past solution,
even reuse the solution in totality or parts. This can reduce the cost and let
the service provider staff the team with people with less domain knowledge.

Code reuse at different levels of granularity---lines-of-code level, API level,
and even complete solutions---has been an area of interest in the
software-engineering community~\cite{Holmes:2013,Reiss:2009}. Much of this work
could be applied in the setting of software services too. However, in the
services context, because code is developed for a particular client, the
intellectual property ownership of the code could become an issue. If the code
is solely owned by the client, making it available in a shared repository would
not be possible. Services organizations often face the challenge of convincing
clients of the benefits of sharing artifacts created as part of a service
engagement into cross-account repositories maintained by the service
providers. Experience reports and user studies that quantify effort reduction
and/or quality improvement from code reuse can help service organizations
convince the clients of the potential benefits of artifact sharing and reuse.

\subsubsection{Service Improvement}

When a client outsources application maintenance to a vendor, one of the key
expectations is that the vendor would bring down their total cost of ownership
over time. This requires the vendor to seek out proactively areas for
improvement in the client application portfolio. One way to do this is via
benchmarking the performance of the client applications against similar
applications in other client landscapes. To illustrate, suppose that a service
company maintains the payroll applications for 10~clients. For nine of the
clients, the monthly ticket volumes range between 5 and 10 tickets, whereas, for
the remaining client (say client~A), the ticket volume ranges from 20 to
50. This indicates that, for client~A, it may be worthwhile to investigate
reasons for high ticket volumes and determine whether preventive actions could
be taken. Moreover, if a similar problem was seen in the past in another
client's payroll system, information about the actions taken for that client
could help the team resolve the problem for client~A.

Many organizations (\eg CAST, Software Engineering Institute) collect
quantitative and qualitative benchmark information for software projects and
business applications based on languages used, number of users, etc.  For a
service company, which does software implementations for multiple clients, an
organization-wide knowledge base that (1) captures key operational metrics per
application (or by problem area) and the past improvement actions taken for each
client, and (2) permits comparisons between clients with similar applications
and problems encountered, would improve upon what is publicly available and be
more useful.

%% There are a number of organizations that gather and report quantitative
%% benchmark information (qualitiative as well as productivity) for software
%% projects and business applications depending on language used to code, number of
%% users etc. CAST, Software Engineering Institute are some examples of such
%% organizations. However, considering services organizations are doing multiple
%% software implementations for multiple clients, an organization-wide knowledge
%% base that (1) captures key operational metrics per application (or at a more
%% granular level, such as by problem area) per client and the past improvement
%% actions taken, and (2) allows comparisons between clients with similar
%% applications and problems encountered, would help augment what is publicly
%% available and be more useful.

\subsection{Research Topics}

Based on such OKMS needs in IBM's service-delivery organization, there have been
efforts toward implementing systems to address the needs. These include a system
for promoting solution reuse in software development engagements centered around
business-process transformation~\cite{Goodwin:2012b}, and a system for sharing
information about problem tickets across client
engagements~\cite{Majumdar:2011}.

Next, we discuss some core research problems that need to be addressed in
creating effective knowledge-management systems in service organizations. At the
simplest level, an OKMS is a database where content can be stored and retrieved
from. However, what content should be stored, how easily can the content be
collected, and the ease with which relevant content can be retrieved determines
the usefulness of an OKMS.  Figure~\ref{fig-km} presents several activities
(shown as block arrows) that need to be performed in creating and using an OKMS;
for each activity, the figure displays relevant topics (shown in the boxes) that
would benefit from further research. The activities are broadly classified into
two categories: knowledge creation and knowledge retrieval.
