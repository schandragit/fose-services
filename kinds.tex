\section{Examples of Services Engagements}

To make the setting concrete, we give a couple of examples of services engagements. 

Consider a US-based health-case management company that needs to incorporate support for a newly passed patient privacy legislation in their software. Over the years, this company has accumulated dozen of applications implemented in a variety of technologies. It did not make business sense to keep in-house staff around to be able to make transformational changes to the application. The company decides to use a software services company to make this change. While they are at it, they decided to try out outsourcing support activities to the services company.  Thus, vendors are invited to submit proposals to transform the application suite, test it, and then continue to provide steady state maintenance service.

Software services vendors respond to the request for proposals by a plan of what they would do, along with the cost. To differentiate themselves, they need to show what innovations they bring to the table that helps the health management company in terms of cost or quality. For example, a differentiator could be that the vendor has previously worked on similar transformational effort for another health-case management company. (Need to talk about technical innovations such as knowledge reuse.) Since cost is an important consideration, the vendors need to assess labor cost in carrying out this work, and this is where their own internal efficiency matters.

Enhancements.

Maintenance.
