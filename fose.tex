\begin{abstract}
Software services companies offer software development, testing and maintenance as a ``service'' to other organizations.  Software services offers certain unique research problems as well as different takes on research problems typically considered in software engineering research. In this paper, we highlight some of these research problems, drawing upon our involvement with IBM Global Business Services organization over the past several years.  We focus on four selected topics: how to structure people and the flow of work through people, how to manage knowledge at an organizational level, how to estimate and manage risk, and finally, testing services. These topics do not cover all areas pertinent to software services, but do reflect ones in which we have personal perspectives to offer.  We also share our experience in deployment of various research innovations in software services in the context of a large service delivery organization.
