Software development is most visibly associated with companies that manufacture software products.  Corporate names such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, Oracle, and so on are well-known software companies.  These companies have several software  products that are offered to individual consumers and businesses.

In the broader information technology ecosystem, software development is also associated with ``services companies''.  Instead of offering software products, these companies develop software for other businesses, i.e. they offer software development as a service.\footnote{Note to be confused with software-as-a-service, which is a way to deliver software products.} Examples of service companies include Accenture, Cap Gemini, Tata, Infosys, Atos, and so on; in addition, companies such as IBM and HP have a large services business in addition to software and hardware business.

There are two main drivers for demand for software development as a service.  First, most businesses prefer to focus on their core competence, rather than develop in house competence for software development.  For example, every company in financial sector relies heavily on information technology, but information technology is not the basis on which they differentiate themselves in that sector. Therefore they do not want to run large teams that have in-house expertise in ever growing set of software technologies, when they can get easily procure IT services on demand from service companies. Second, although a lot of business software functionality is now available in pre-packaged applications, it is not realistic to run an enterprise entirely with off-the-shelf software. Significant customization and systems integration is required to run any large enterprise, even if substantial building blocks are available off the shelf. Moreover, custom software must be maintained to incorporate new business needs or to accommodate legislative compliance, and continually upgraded to newer technologies such as cloud. Service companies have deep industry as well as technology expertise to cater to these needs. The fact that services companies can also deliver services efficiently using a large pool of global resources is an added benefit. 

Like software product companies, services companies also employ software engineers in large numbers. Given the scale of operations, many of the usual challenges in software engineering that are well known from product development context also apply in the context of services.  However, the two kinds of businesses have some differences, due to which certain challenges become more pronounced for services companies. The most salient difference is this: product companies compete in the market they serve on the basis of the features offered in their product and how well it anticipate their customers' needs. Thus, their main focus is on innovation in identifying new needs that their customers would be willing to pay for, and bringing out a product to cater to those needs before their competition does. By contrast, services companies do not compete on the basis of the features of any product; rather they compete in terms of the ``quality of service'' that they offer to the business that purchase their services. Here, quality of service informally means several things that one may associate with any services business, even outside of information technology: can the service provider deliver on their contract on time, with acceptable work quality, and at a competitive price.  Therefore, the innovation in service companies has to do with techniques to carry out projects reliably, on time, with acceptable quality, and manage the cost.

Another important difference is that in product companies, copies of the same product is sold to a large number of customers, and typically the transaction is one time payment of license fee.  A services company provides services to a much smaller number of clients, and the transaction is an ongoing relationship rather than a one-time payment of license fee. This has an important bearing in deployment of innovation.  A product company must be extremely careful in choosing what innovations to productize, because they cannot afford to get it wrong; however, if successfully shipped, the innovation automatically makes its way to a large number of users.  In a services company, the innovation is somewhat less risky, but it does not scale automatically: it might take just as much work in rolling out an innovation to the next client as it did for the first client.

The way innovation is 

%% The global market for software services is almost the same size as the market for software products in terms of revenues.
